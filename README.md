Truncate JSON Arrays Utility
This utility provides a scalable JavaScript function to truncate all arrays in a JSON object, keeping only the first element in each array. It's especially useful when working with large JSON payloads and you want a lightweight version for previews, logging, or testing.

✨ Features
✅ Works recursively on nested objects

✅ Automatically detects and truncates arrays

✅ Preserves structure and key names

✅ No hardcoded keys – fully generic
